About the Online Mobile Store Management System
The Online Mobile Store Management System has 2 sides of the user interface which are the Admin Panel and Client/Public-Side. The Admin Panel can be accessed only by the management or the system admin user while the clients or possible client can freely create their system account in order to use the important features of the system such as shopping cart and placing orders. All of the data/information that can be found on the client/public side can be configure or modified through the admin panel. This system also generates a printable date-wise sales report.

This web application was developed using PHP, MySQL Database, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Ajax & jQuery), Bootstrap, AdminLTE Template, and some other libraries/plugins. I created this project using XAMPP version 3.30 and does have a PHP version of 8.0.7.
